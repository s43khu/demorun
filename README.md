export const challenges = [
  {
    id: 'new_achievement',
    name: 'New Achievement',
    description: 'Description here',
    requirement: 100,
    type: 'height', // or 'coins', 'gems', 'jumps'
    reward: 50,
  },
];
```

### Modifying Levels

Edit the `generateEnhancedLevels` function in `frontend/src/levels/enhancedLevels.js` to add new platforms, collectibles, or hazards.

## üêõ Known Issues & Solutions

### Achievement Flickering

- **Issue**: Achievements were flickering on every key press
- **Solution**: Added proper state management with `unlockedAchievements` Set to track already unlocked achievements

### Missing Right Border

- **Issue**: Players could go through the right border
- **Solution**: Removed world wrapping and ensured all platforms stay within bounds

### Collectibles Falling Through Platforms

- **Issue**: Collectibles were falling through platforms
- **Solution**: Applied physics to collectibles and added collision detection

### Height Calculation

- **Issue**: Height was decreasing when going up
- **Solution**: Fixed calculation to start at 0 and increase as you climb
